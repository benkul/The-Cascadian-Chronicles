The-Cascadian-Chronicles
========================
The Cascadian Chronicles was the project that got me interested in computer programming.  It was built using RPG Maker VX Ace which utilizes Ruby.  In the process of working on the game, I installed scripts developed by other users that required customization and configuration to work with my project and to work in conjunction.  This process of exploration led to a more serious interest in programming.  

Though this project is not an example of my programming chops, it taught me several very important lessons.  The first is in regard to project scope.  My inital plans were extraordinarily ambitious and required significant scaling back to match my level of skill.  I learned a lot about modular development and the importance of being able to test small chunks of code to ensure they work smoothly.  

The second lesson was about my own drive.  At completion, I've committed almost three hundred hours to the project.  It is by far the most time-consuming single project I've ever worked on.  I frequently considered stopping and working on something less ambitious, but I'm glad I saw this through to completion.  Working on TCC before going to my job and at night after work taught me that I'm actually far more driven than I thought I was.  

Finally, I learned a lot about the overall arc of developing a project, the absolute importance of incremental develoment and the necessity and challenge of recruiting and utilizing testers.
